# Degrade [stackedit](https://github.com/benweet/stackedit) as a local markdown editor

stackit is a simple fork form [stackedit.io](stackedit.io). to make it as a local markdown editor.

you can edit markdown on either local editor or launched browser, it will be synchronized by [socket.io](socket
.io)



# Usage



```shell
npm install -g stackit
stackit path/to/README.md

```


##Why?

1. stackedit is awesome, but it is not a local editor
2. people may like editing markdown local(like me), but live preview on web. 


## WARNING

haven't test on Windows now.
